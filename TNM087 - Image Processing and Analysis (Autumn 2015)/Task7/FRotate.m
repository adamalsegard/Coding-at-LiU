%% Syntax of the function
%
% Input arguments:  OImage original image
%                   center 2-vector with center point of the rotation
%                       see the pdf for an definition of center
%                   degangle rotation angle in degrees, rotation is
%                       clockwise
%
% Output arguments: RImage is the rotated image
%
% You MUST NEVER change the first line

%% Basic version control (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
% Version: 1
% Date: 2015-11-30
%
% Gives a history of your submission to Lisam.
% Version and date for this function have to be updated before each
% submission to Lisam (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
%% General rules
%
% 1) Don't change the structure of the template by removing %% lines
%
% 2) Document what you are doing using comments
%
% 3) Before submitting make the code readable by using automatic indentation
%       ctrl-a / ctrl-i
%
% 4) In case a task requires that you have to submit more than one function
%       save every function in a single file and collect all of them in a
%       zip-archive and upload that to Lisam. NO RAR, NO GZ, ONLY ZIP!
%       All non-zip archives will be rejected automatically
%
% 5) Often you must do something else between the given commands in the
%       template

%% Information about the image (size, type etc)
%       You can assume that it has uint8 pixels
%       What should you do if this is not the case?
%
[sr,sc,nc] = size(OImage);
OImage = uint8(OImage);

%% Generate coordinate vectors for the shifted coordinate system
% (this means converting the index vector for a pixel to the
%   coordinate vector of the same pixel)
%
ir = 1:sr; %index vector for pixels along first Matlab dimension
ic = 1:sc; %same in the second direction

cir = ir-center(1); %shifted ir vector so that center(1) is the origin
cic = ic-center(2); %Same for the second axis

%% Use cir and cic in meshgrid to generate a coordinate grid
%
[C,R] = meshgrid(cic,cir); % cir, cic

%% The polar mesh coordinates are computed with cart2pol
%
[Theta,Rho] = cart2pol(C,R); %

%% Convert the degress, modify the angles and
%   transform back to Euclidean coordinates
%   you may skip the next two lines and modify the input to pol2cart
%   if you want

rads = (degangle*pi)/180; % degs...
TNew = Theta+rads;  % use Theta and degs

[nC,nR] = pol2cart(TNew, Rho); %

%% Compute the index vector from the coordinate vector inverting the
% previous conversion from ir to cir and ic to cic

newir = nR+center(1);
%newir(newir < 1) = 1;
%newir(newir > length(OImage(:,1))) = length(OImage(:,1));

newic = nC+center(2);
%newic(newic < 1) = 1;
%newic(newic > length(OImage(1,:))) = length(OImage(1,:));

%% Now use nearest neighbor interpolation (round) and rotate

RImage = uint8(zeros(sr,sc,nc));


for k = 1:sr;
    for l = 1:sc;
        if(newir(k,l)>1 && newir(k,l) < length(OImage(:,1,1)) && newic(k,l)>1 && newic(k,l) < length(OImage(1,:,1)))
            RImage(k, l, :) = OImage(round(newir(k,l)), round(newic(k,l)) ,:);
        else
            RImage(k, l, :) = 0;
        end
    end
end
